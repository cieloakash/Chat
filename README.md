üìå Overview
This project is a full-stack authentication system built with modern web technologies. It combines React for the frontend and Express with Mongoose for the backend, ensuring secure user authentication and real-time functionality.

The authentication system includes JWT-based login, password reset via OTP, and session management with protected routes. Users can securely log in, receive OTP emails for password recovery, and manage their credentials effectively. Nodemailer handles email communication, while Cloudinary manages media storage for profile images or documents.

For real-time features, Socket.IO enables live updates and instant notifications, ensuring seamless interaction. The frontend is powered by React Router for navigation, Zustand for state management, and Tailwind CSS for a fully responsive design.

Additional enhancements include form validation, loading states, and error handling, creating a smooth and user-friendly experience.
